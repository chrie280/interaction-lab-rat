It has a landing page, the shapes are interactive. Reactive touch. THey display a title card. Two way to navigate the website, through the nav bar and the shapes which give the same interlinks. 

There were 6 shapes and 5 nav bar links, the 6th shape was to an events page, which would have never been found unless explored. Has contact info in nav bar. Directory looks like business card.

Not a scrollable website. In each interlink there is a game thing. Three major elements on homepage, directory, footer contact info, and reservation.

Landing page is flowers which when you scroll down reveal the rest of the website. Directory mimics landing page with internal links. Bold consistent usage of font in varying weights and colors. Integrates type and image in harmony. More information as you scroll. 


Secondary nav bar in “menu” section. You work your way through the directory as you scroll, anyways. About page after menu, parallax effect photos of the environment. Color scheme is consistent with 1600s french cottage in a forest. Custom gmap with colors and coffee logos.

Landing page with directory on left side . Creators/google bar on top right. Left drop down/hamburger menu for navigation, right side rop down for settings. Five main pages on left menu, persists through website, scroll down for more youtube pages., always displayed. 8 total videos fill screen, broken up by recommended, trending, etc. Infinite videos with no categorization. Youtube inherently as a website doesn’t need many pages, as it is a platform for delivering one thing only, and you don't need much fluff around that.
